<strong>BALLS
</strong><br />
( Time Limit: 1s )<br />
You have boxes of Type 1 which has capacity to store N1 balls and  boxes of Type 2 can store N2 balls. Type 1 costs C1 and Type 2 costs C2. You have N balls with you and would like to store all of them in either of these boxes such that each box is filled to its capacity. But you are low on cash so you dont want to spend more than required. Given these data, print the cheapest way solution (value of the number of boxes of type 1 and type 2 seperated by space on a single line) to perform this or print "failed" if it is not possible (quotes for clarity).
<br />
<br />
<strong>Input:</strong><br />
A test file contains multiple cases. Each case begins with N on a seperate line, followed by two lines. First line contains C1 and N1 (type1 ) and the next line contains C2 and N2, seperated by space. The file ends with N=0. Assume that N,C1,C2,N1,N2 are all positive and smaller than 2000000000.
<br />
<strong>Output:</strong><br />
For each case, print the cheapest cost solution (value of the number of boxes of type 1 and type 2 seperated by space on a single line) of performing the task or print "failed" if its impossible.
