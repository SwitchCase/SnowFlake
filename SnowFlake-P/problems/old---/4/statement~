Problem: No Problem

Your have been given some problems to solve. You have to first solve problem 0. 
Suppose you solve problem i, then you can solve either problem i+1 or skip ahead to problem i+2. 
You are not allowed to skip more than one problem. For example, {0, 2, 4, 5} is a valid order, 
but {0, 1, 3, 7} is not because the skip from 3 to 7 is too long.

Each problem has a score, where score[i] indicates score of problem i. 
You can stop solving problems once the range of score you've encountered reaches a certain threshold. 
Specifically, you may stop once the difference between the maximum and minimum score of the 
problems you've solved is greater than or equal to the 'threshhold'. 
If this never happens, you must solve all the problems. Return the minimum number of problems you must 
solve to satisfy the given requirements. 

Input:
First line contains number of test cases.
Each test cases are separated by a blank line. First line of each test case contains N (number of problems).
Then follow a line containing N integers which are the scores of the problems.
Next line contains an integer T (threshhold).

Output:
For each test case output a single line containing the minimum number of problems you must 
solve to satisfy the given requirements.
