Dave found an old maths book in his primary schooling rug. He randomly <br/>
turned to a page which taught him addition. But, to his amazement, <br/>
all the + symbols from the text were missing to give a final sum. <br/>
Now, he found it as a challenge to put in the missing '+'es in the<br/>
 script to find the given sum. Your task is to find the minimum no. <br/>
 of such '+'es between the script.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>INPUT:</strong>
You will be given upto 10 test cases separated by an End of Line (\n) <br/>
and ended by EOF (End of File). Each test case will contain a string split <br/>
into 2 parts by an '=' symbol (No white spaces). First part will contain a <br/>
string of upto 1000 characters (and may contain leading zeroes like "0008" would mean 8)<br/>
 and second will contain a value (<=5000).<br/>
<br/>
<strong>OUTPUT:</strong><br/>
An integral value of the minimum no. of '+'es in the script required.
