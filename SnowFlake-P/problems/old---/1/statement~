You are given n digits(0-9). Rearrange them so that the integer so formed has the least number of divisors.
<br/>
If more than one solution exits output the smallest one. You can use the digit '0' as leading digit.
<br/>
<strong>Constraints:</strong>
<br/>
1&lt;= n &lt;= 5
<br/>
Input contains atleast one non-zero digit.
 
<strong>Input:</strong>
Input contains more than one test case.(number of test cases < 30)<br/>
Each line has one test case.<br/>
Each line contains the n digits for each test case.<br/>
Take input until end of file.<br/>
<br/>

<strong>Output:</strong>
One line for each test case, containing the rearraged integer with samllest number of divisors.

<strong> Time Limit: </strong> &nbsp; 5s
