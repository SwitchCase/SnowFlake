Building A City:

A new city is to be constructed with n buildings. Each building is assigned to a builder. The builder responsible for ith building, constructs it at a rate of one floor per D[i] days.

Construction work stops on the day when the total number of floors in all buildings sum up to m.

Now given n, m and D[1..n], You need to accurately estimate the no. of days required for construction.


Input:

There are several test cases(<50). Each test case consists of two lines.
First line contains n and m. Second line contains n integers representing the values of D[1 to n].
Input ends with n and m equal to 0 0.

Output:

For each test case print the no. of days required for completion of n floors in all.

Constraints:

0< n <100000
0< D[i] <50
0< m <2^60


Sample input:

3 4
1 3 2

0 0

Sample output:

3
