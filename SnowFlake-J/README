4 Setting up SnowFlake
4.1 Creating Config File
__________________________________________________________________________

1. Directory Structure
----------------------
Currently SnowFlake consists of four directories.

1.1 include
-----------
This contails the header files necessary for snowflake to run. snowflake.h
is the SnowFlake header file. The rest of them are part of the two 3rd 
party Open Source Libraries - libconfig and argtable.

1.2 exec
--------
All binaries that are built are stored in this directory

1.3 src
-------

All source code (.c,.cpp etc) are stored here.

1.4 libs
--------
The libraries libconfig and argtable reside in this directory. Apart from 
these two, SnowFlake also need MySQL which is installed on the system.
__________________________________________________________________________

2. What Happens Behind the Scenes
---------------------------------
SnowFlake service periodically queries the DATABASE on the DATABASE TABLE 
specified in the config file and checks to see if there are any 
submissions that need processing. Once it realizes that there are such 
items in the queue, it tries to see if it is possible to process them.
If it sees it fit, it will remove the item from this queue and set up 
the JUDGE and run it. Based on the result, it will update the 
DATABASE TABLE with the verdict.
__________________________________________________________________________

3. Logs
-------
SnowFlake typically logs everything onto a log file at 
/var/log/snowflake.log. If snowflake-debug is run, then all log data is 
redirected to the terminal.

4. Setting up Snowflake
-----------------------

4.1 Configuring SnowFlake
-------------------------
The default Snowflake config file is /etc/snowflake.conf. It can be changed
via the cmd line option '--config <FILE>'. Config File must have this 
format with these values set -
username = "<MYSQL USER>";
password = "<MYSQL USER PASSWORD>";
server = "<MYSQL SERVER>";
db_name = "<MYSQL DATABASE NAME>";
db_table = "<MYSQL DB TABLE>";
